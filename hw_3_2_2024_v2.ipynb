    "7.Human Development Index(HDI) Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, which are used to rank countries into four apsects of human development: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Life expectancy at birth.\n",
    "2. Average number of years of education received by people aged 25 and older.\n",
    "3. Expected years of schooling for children entering school.\n",
    "4. Gross National Income per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "But....these measures need to be normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing the four factors—life expectancy, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and GNI per capita—is crucial for calculating the Human Development Index (HDI) correctly for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Different Units and Scales*\n",
    "The four factors are measured in entirely different units and scales. Life expectancy is measured in years, schooling years are also in years, but they represent different aspects of education, and GNI per capita is measured in dollars. Normalization transforms these variables into a comparable scale (usually between 0 and 1), allowing for a meaningful aggregation into a single index.\n",
    "2. *Combining Indices*\n",
    "The HDI is a composite index that combines indicators of health, education, and income. To accurately reflect improvements or declines across these varied dimensions, each factor must contribute proportionately to the final index. Without normalization, a high value in one dimension could disproportionately affect the HDI, obscuring significant deficiencies in another dimension.\n",
    "3. *Geometric Mean Calculation*\n",
    "The HDI uses the geometric mean of the normalized indices rather than an arithmetic mean. This choice ensures that severe underperformance in any single dimension (approaching zero) will have a more substantial impact on the overall HDI, promoting a more balanced approach to development. The geometric mean can only be meaningfully calculated if all values are on the same positive scale.\n",
    "4. *Comparability Over Time and Across Countries*\n",
    "Normalization allows for the comparison of HDI scores over time and between countries. By using fixed hypothetical minimum and maximum values for normalization, the HDI can track progress or decline in human development even as absolute conditions change. It ensures that the index remains relevant and comparable despite changes in global standards of living, educational attainment, or life expectancy.\n",
    "5. *Reducing Skewness and Enhancing Sensitivity*\n",
    "For GNI per capita, specifically, the logarithmic transformation helps manage the skewness caused by the wide range of income levels across the world. This transformation ensures that proportional differences at lower levels of income are given comparable weight to similar proportional differences at higher levels of income, enhancing the sensitivity of the HDI to improvements in living standards across all income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...normalization is a **methodological necessity** in constructing the HDI. It allows for the equitable integration of diverse human development indicators into a unified framework, enabling policymakers, researchers, and the public to assess and compare the overall level of human development across different contexts and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are your helpful guidelines for constructing the logic of this function:\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! In your last semester at Yale, you got a job at the World Bank ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Your first assignment is to address the dearth of good data in Mali on Mango quality and production. Your boss put you on a plane to Mali during the harvest season. You are excited, not only because your boss is annoying and wears too much cologne, but international travel is part of the excitement of an international job. You are excited to see the Great Mosque of Djenne, to watch the sunset from the Bandiagara Cliffs, and to dance the night away to  at Le Byblos. Oh yeah, there is the work too. After a particular \"rough\" night you meet with your colleagues at the office.  You thought you'd be able to just get by making eye contact and nodding while they did most of the work. After all, you are new to the role. No such luck. Your colleagues are thrilled that you can solve their problems by creating an automated call center. Their exact words are, \"The Harvard grad ended up quitting, I'm glad we have someone from Yale here to make things right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an office and a computer. You may have slightly overstated your Python coding skills to get the job, but too late now. They ask if you mind if they watch you code. You tell them that you prefer to work alone, although ask them to lunch later to soften the push back. After the initial panic and hangover subsides you think back to your days in intermediate python at Yale, the encouraging words of your caring but demanding prof,  and then a light flashes in your mind and you think, \"I got this.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "You've been tasked with the goal of setting up an automated call center to get data on current market prices, production and quality. There are growers who are both collectives who report these factors, and also smaller growers! Unfortunately, some of these are incentivized to underreport production and prices under the assumption that they will receive more foreign aid. Not all of them though! It's estimated that 10-20% of the self-reporting is innacurate. Callers call the center. Words are processed from speech to text. Text is processed, converted back to speech and then communicated to the caller. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few challenges you face: \n",
    "1. The speech to text algo was trained on French, but most of the farmers who call in speak Bambara. You must translate from Bambara to French, and then French to English, because your boss doesn't speak French and wants things in English and is completely unreasonable.\n",
    "2. Sometimes the call just ends, sometimes words are sporadic, sometimes the algo. confuses the word \"child\" and the word \"mango\"\n",
    "3. The call in number was once the number for the infant health hotline. People still use the number to try to get immediate emergency care for their infant. Their calls must be redirected or children could die and it would be your fault, not to mention an international incident.\n",
    "4. The call number is often called by fans and musicians who are given the number by directory assistance because there is a music production company called Mango Mali, a fledgling world music group that markets music from Mali to France.\n",
    "5. You must try to identify who is lying about their crop yield quality and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR MISSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that accepts the number as an input and then collects user input(in Bambara), translates it to French, and then outputs the data to a csv file in English. Please make sure you write code that addresses the challenges above (1-5). \n",
    "Create use cases to demonstrate that your code works and that you have addressed the basic use case, and that you have addressed challenges 1-5."
